						<h3>MEASUREMENTS</h3>

							general 0.5" tolerance of those measurements.
						</p>
						<p>

							version of the measurements will be referred to as the base measurement for the customer
							profile.
						</p>
						<ul>

							</li>

									particular order. Any measurement changes from the profile or other orders won't be
									applied to this order.
