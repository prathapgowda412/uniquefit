            All data is encrypted via SSL/TLS when transmitted from our servers
            to your browser. The database backups are also encrypted. Except for
            your password, data isn’t encrypted while it’s live in our database
            (since it needs to be ready to send to you when you need it).

            <strong>What are cookies?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Cookies are pieces of information that a website places on the hard
            drive of your computer when you visit the website. Cookies may
            involve the transmission of information from us to you and from you
            directly to us, to another party on our behalf, or to another party
            in accordance with its privacy policy. You can choose to have your
            computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can
            choose to turn off all cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won’t
            have access to many features that make your guest experience more
            efficient and some of our services will not function properly.

            <strong>How do we use cookies?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            We and certain service providers operating on our behalf collect
            information about your activity on our Services using tracking
            technologies such as cookies, flash cookies and web beacons. We use
            two types: persistent cookies and session cookies. A persistent
            cookie helps us recognize you as an existing user, so it’s easier to
            return to the Services or interact with our Services without signing
            in again. After you sign in, a persistent cookie stays in your
            browser and will be read by us when you return to one of our
            products. Session cookies only last for as long as the session
            (usually the current visit to a website or a browser session). This
            tracking data is used for many purposes including, for example, to:
